## Project Overview

This Tableau dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of house sales in Washington. The main goal is to visualize various aspects of house sales data, including price distribution, bathroom and bedroom distributions, and the impact of different variables such as year built, square footage, and lot size on house prices.

### Dashboard Description

   - Visualizes the daily average sales price of houses.

2. **Distribution of House Prices**
   - Shows the distribution of house prices across different price ranges.

3. **Distribution of Bathrooms and Bedrooms**
   - Displays the distribution of the number of bathrooms and bedrooms in the houses sold.

4. **Map**
   - Maps the house sales data geographically.

5. **Filters**
   - Allows users to filter the data by selecting the month and day from a calendar, as well as by year built, square footage, and lot size.

6. **View - Condition**

### Key Insights

- Houses with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms are the most common.
- The average house price fluctuates daily but generally remains within a predictable range.
